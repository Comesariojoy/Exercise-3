    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b> Steps on how to do pancake</b></h1>
    <br>
    <ol style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger;">
        <li> <b> Grab a griddle or large nonstick skillet.</b></li>
            <dd style="font-size: large;">The secret to a perfect pancake is all in the flip, and flipping is easier to do on something like a griddle, which is totally flat and has a large, forgiving surface area. 
                <br>
            </dd><br>
            <li><b>
                Preheat and lightly grease your pan.</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size: large;"> If you start your pancake on a cold pan, you are not setting yourself up for success. Pancake batter needs quick, instant heat to properly rise and develop a perfect brown color. </dd>
            <li><b>
                Use a simple ratio to make batter.</b></li>
                As all of the thousands of pancake recipes on the Internet prove, you can make the breakfast food with just about anything. Just be sure to follow a ratio of 1 cup of wet ingredients to 1 cup of dry ingredients            <li><b>
                    Don't overbeat the batter.</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size:large">a good pancake batter will look lumpy and have the consistency of cottage cheese. The more you work it the flatter and tougher the pancakes will end up being. Gently mix the ingredients together—you'll know you're done when the flour is fully incorporated and you can't see it anymore.</dd><br>
            <li><b>
                Cook each pancake until bubbles form on top.</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size: large;">Spoon batter for each pancake into the pre-heated pan with a ladle. If you don't have one, you can also use a measuring cup, or simply pour from the mixing bowl if you're feeling really confident.</i></dd><br>
            <li><b>
                Add toppings before you flip.</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size: large;">If you want to add toppings, its best to do it straight into each pancake before you flip it. Whether you're using fruit, nuts, or chocolate, this method will always yield the best results.</dd><br>
            <li><b>
                Flip and let cook for another minute.</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size: large;">When a pancake is ready, tuck your spatula completely under it so it's fully supported when you lift. This will help prevent it from breaking. Don't spend too much time thinking about the flip, though—just do it! If you mess up, it's really no big deal. Practice makes perfect and at least you can still eat your mistake in this case.</dd><br>
